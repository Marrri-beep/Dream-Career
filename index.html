	      <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
	      <p></p>
	      <p>After waking up and doing my morning hygiene routine, is when I'll start working. I begin by checking the latest architecture news, This helps me stay updated with current trends and competitions.
			I also read architecture blogs and articles. Talking about reading, I also like to look through architectural imagery and design portfolios to fuel my inspiration.
			I will then review past sketches or design ideas I’ve been working on. I'll see what can be improved or expanded. If there's project that's yet to be finished, I pick up where I left off.
			If I’m not working on projects or commissions, I'll take time to journal my architectural thoughts,
			 by doing this, it helps me stretch my creative thinking and build a personal archive of ideas I might develop later.
			 I will then go through my emails to see if there are any updates from clients or collaborators. To make sure I don't miss anything, I go through my schedule for the day and the week ahead. I review deadlines and upcoming meetings.

	      <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
	      <p></p>
	      <p>During this time, I'll dedicate myself to do design work, where I continue creating my current projects. 
			Later in the day, I head to the construction site to meet with my client and if needed, the contractors or engineers involved in the build too. On-site, I take time to observe the current progress of the constructon, I'll check if the work is progressing according to the design I made and help in resolving issues.

	      <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
	      <p> I've seen this building in real life, the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. The Architect behind it, Moshe Safdie, saw a deck of cards being shuffled then an idea popped into his head, “What if I design a building that looks like a deck of cards, stacked and ready to play?” 
			Moshe designed three towers, each one resembling a card leaning against the others. And right on top, he placed a massive “ship” that seemed to defy gravity. Seeing this masterpiece amazed me, his creativity is inspiring.
